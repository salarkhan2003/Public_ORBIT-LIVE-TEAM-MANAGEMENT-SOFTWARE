## ✍️ Writing Tips

### Do's
✅ **Use active voice:** "Save 10 hours" not "10 hours can be saved"  
✅ **Be specific:** "87% reduction" not "significant improvement"  
✅ **Address pain first:** "Stop wasting time on..." then solution  
✅ **Use power words:** Transform, eliminate, accelerate, optimize  
✅ **Include social proof:** "50,000+ teams" builds trust  

### Don'ts
❌ **Avoid jargon:** "Synergize holistic solutions" 🙅  
❌ **Don't be vague:** "Better productivity" (how much better?)  
❌ **Skip generic claims:** "Best-in-class" (everyone says this)  
❌ **Avoid passive voice:** "Can be configured" → "Configure easily"  
❌ **Don't bury the lead:** Benefit first, then feature
